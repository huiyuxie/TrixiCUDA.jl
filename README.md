TrixiCUDA.jl offers CUDA acceleration for solving hyperbolic PDEs.

*Update on Nov 21, 2024*: 
- Due to the [issue](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/issues/2108) from upstream with Trixi.jl and CUDA.jl in Julia v1.11, this package now supports only Julia v1.10. Using or developing this package with Julia v1.11 will result in precompilation errors. To fix this, downgrade to Julia v1.10. If you have any other problems, please file issues [here](https://github.com/trixi-gpu/TrixiCUDA.jl/issues).

*Update on Oct 30, 2024*: 
- The general documentation is now available at https://trixi-gpu.github.io (in development).  
- Documentation specific to this package can be found at https://trixi-gpu.github.io/TrixiCUDA.jl/dev (in development).

*Update on Sep 16, 2024*:
- GPU-related tests are run now locally rather than on CI. Once the package is ready to publish, we will set up JuliaGPU CI infrastructure to run tests on a system with a GPU using [JuliaGPU Buildkite](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/buildkite).

# Package Installation
The package is now in pre-release status and will be registered once the initial release version is published. We want to make sure most key features are ready and optimizations are done before we roll out the first release.

## Users
Users who are interested now can install the package by running the following command in the Julia REPL: 
```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/trixi-gpu/TrixiCUDA.jl.git")
```
Then the package can be used with the following simple command:
```julia
julia> using TrixiCUDA
```
This package serves as a support package, so it is recommended to these packages together:
```julia
julia> using Trixi, TrixiCUDA, OrdinaryDiffEq
```

## Developers
Developers can start their development by first forking and cloning the repository to their terminal. 

Then enter the Julia REPL in the package directory, activate and instantiate the environment by running the following command:
```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate()
```

# Supported Mesh and Solver Types
Our current focus is on the semidiscretization of PDEs. The table below shows the status of this work across different mesh types and solvers. Looking ahead, we plan to extend parallelization to include mesh initialization and callbacks on the GPU. 

| Mesh Type          | Spatial Dimension | Solver Type | Status         |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| `TreeMesh`         | 1D, 2D, 3D        | `DGSEM`     | ‚úÖ Supported    |
| `StructuredMesh`   | 1D, 2D, 3D        | `DGSEM`     | üõ†Ô∏è In Development|
| `UnstructuredMesh` | 2D                | `DGSEM`     | üü° Planned      |
| `P4estMesh`        | 2D, 3D            | `DGSEM`     | üü° Planned      |
| `DGMultiMesh`      | 1D, 2D, 3D        | `DGMulti`   | üü° Planned      |

# Example of PDE Semidiscretization on GPU
Let's take a look at a simple example to see how to use **TrixiCUDA.jl** to run the simulation on the GPU (now only CUDA-compatible).

```julia
# Take 1D linear advection equation as an example
using Trixi, TrixiCUDA
using OrdinaryDiffEq

###############################################################################
# semidiscretization of the linear advection equation

advection_velocity = 1.0
equations = LinearScalarAdvectionEquation1D(advection_velocity)

solver = DGSEM(polydeg = 3, surface_flux = flux_lax_friedrichs)

coordinates_min = -1.0
coordinates_max = 1.0 

mesh = TreeMesh(coordinates_min, coordinates_max,
                initial_refinement_level = 4,
                n_cells_max = 30_000)

semi = SemidiscretizationHyperbolic(mesh, equations, initial_condition_convergence_test,
                                    solver)

###############################################################################
# ODE solvers, callbacks etc.

ode = semidiscretizeGPU(semi, (0.0, 1.0)) # from TrixiCUDA.jl

summary_callback = SummaryCallback()

analysis_callback = AnalysisCallback(semi, interval = 100)

save_solution = SaveSolutionCallback(interval = 100,
                                     solution_variables = cons2prim)

stepsize_callback = StepsizeCallback(cfl = 1.6)

callbacks = CallbackSet(summary_callback, analysis_callback, save_solution,
                        stepsize_callback)

###############################################################################
# run the simulation

sol = solve(ode, CarpenterKennedy2N54(williamson_condition = false),
            dt = 1.0, save_everystep = false, callback = callbacks)

summary_callback()
```
